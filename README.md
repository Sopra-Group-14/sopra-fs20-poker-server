## Illustrations
To play poker the user needs to register or log in. Then he can create or join a pokergame. The user has an account where he can top up his credit once every 24h. As a not logged in (as well as a logged in) user it is possible to join a game as a spectator and see the hand cards of the different Players as well as some winning odds. 


## Roadmap
We could imagine adding sound effects, card animations as well as a
friend list or private messages to stay in contact with people you liked to play with.
